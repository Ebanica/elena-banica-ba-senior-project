         My project, Climate Change in Abstract Painting, emphasizes different effects of climate change, such as cyanobacteria, dried riverbeds, ice cap floating, drought, melting permafrost, and a tropical cyclone, which have become more visible in the past few years. My inspiration for my project was a CBS News article, Stunning Photos of Climate Change, published on March 9, 2022, which brought to the surface my beautiful memories of my childhood nature. My project combines the effects of climate change with facts to convey to viewers my powerful feelings and concerns about the changes in nature and to call to prevent its destruction by human actions.

        Climate Change in Abstract Painting incorporates six acrylic and black ink abstract oil on canvas paintings, 18 in x 24 in. I decided to emphasize climate change in my project because of my personal experiences. As an adult, I can see the changes in nature, and I want to highlight them in my project to show human rejection of the effects of climate change. If climate change started as a myth in my childhood, it has become a reality. Cyanobacteria Bloom is the first painting of my project. It was inspired by cyanobacteria in the Kyiv Water Reservoir in Ukraine from November 15, 2020, when in Kyiv, the temperature increased due to climate change damaging the environment of that region. When cyanobacteria bloom, the water becomes harmful to the entire ecosystem. All my abstract paintings included in my project highlight the changes in nature and show how the beauty of nature becomes dangerous due to climate change.

        My project, Climate Change in Abstract Painting, emphasizes the effects of climate change that are more visible, but many people still reject them. In my project, I combined abstraction with facts to show human rejection of reality and convey my concerns about climate change. Humans are part of nature. By destroying nature, humans destroy the life on the planet. Through my project, I want to bring awareness and call for human action to stop the harmful human activities on nature.
