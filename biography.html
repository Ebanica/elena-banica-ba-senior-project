        I was born in Romania, a European country, and I came to California in 2017 as an international student. I studied Early Childhood Education and Studio Art at Mission College Santa Clara and Bachelor Art in Studio Practice (Preparation for Teaching) at San Jose State University.

      <h3>
        In elementary school, I discovered my passion for art when my teacher selected some of my class paintings to send to the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), a global agency for helping children in crises from all over the world. At that time, I understood that my paintings turned into stamps for educational purposes. I never saw those stamps, but I became aware of my connection between art, people, and nature. Later, as an art studio student, I studied painting, drawing, digital media, sculpture, photography, and more. In the Spring 2019 semester, one of my digital drawings was exhibited at Mission College Santa Clara, and in the Spring 2023 semester, one of my sculptures was showed at San Jose State University in a student exhibiton. Both exhibitions made me confident and motivated me to follow my passion for art. I chose to focus my art on drawing and painting because I am passionate about pictorial art, and I want to be a professional in the field. In my work, I want to explore as many themes as possible, from the human condition to the environment, because I want to become a powerful voice through my artwork.

        I am interested in nature, especially in climate change. My passion for nature comes from my childhood. As a child, I spent my free time in a village at my grandma's house, swimming with the children in the river or going with my grandma through the forest to pick some mushrooms. Now, as an adult who loves to spend time in the middle of nature, I can see the changes in climate and their effects. As an artist, through my art, I want to make people aware of the changes in nature and call to stop those activities that cause changes in climate and affect the planet.
